# **CSD - Craft Prospect - Neural Navigate**

## Project Description 

Our customer, 'Craft Prospect - A Space Engineering Practice', wanted us to produce a Video-game. 
Craft Prospect wanted our Video-game to link how their satellite worked. Their satellite 
works by orbitting Earthand collecting imagery, which is produced by two cameras working in conjunction. 
The first camera is a static camera that points ahead and evaluates the amount of cloud coverage ahead. 
Meanwhile, the second camera is a moveable camera that aims directly down to the Earth's surface. 
The second camera angles its' trajectory around clouds and turns off if there is complete cloud coverage 
and no sight of the Earth's surface. This is made possible by our customers trained model that is used to 
detect clouds using the front facing camera so that the second camera can effeciently navigate through 
the clouds. This is where the idea of the game came from.   
    
Craft Prospect gave us the task of producing a game that simulated this satellites behaviour, while 
implementing a Neural Network tied into the game to detect clouds, as well as features such as forest fires 
in their satellite imagery. The game is a side-scroller where the player controls 'Satellite Hero' who
is meant to avoid the clouds and detect features in the game.

## Deployment

Our delivered project to the customer is a playable WebGL format of our game called 'Neural Navigate'.
